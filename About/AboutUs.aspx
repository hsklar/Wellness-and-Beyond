  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>We have created a safe, private place to treat an individual’s needs with the specific care necessary 
      to help conquer obstacles to health and happiness. Our practice was established in order to provide 
      comprehensive care to children and families while treating problems such as anxiety, depression, 
      trauma, domestic violence, ADHD, oppositional behavior, and developmental disorders. We provide 
      therapy and tools for living that children and adults can use to better cope with life’s challenges 
      such as divorce, illness, and loss. Our goal is to help our clients develop practical skills and inner 
      strength so they may live their best possible reality. If you or your child is struggling call us for 
      a phone consultation. There is no need to feel alone. With just one call, you can access a team of 
      professionals who will be there for you.</p>
